-- example (2 tables): show employees data ... , beside department_name



-- example (3 tables): show employees data , beside department_name, beside city



-- 2nd syntax 
-- example (2 tables): show employees data ... , beside department_name




-- example (3 tables): show employees data , beside department_name, beside city






-- Cross Join [ bad join ]





-- ## 2. Outer Join Type ## --
-- show employees data beside dept name [ and show also employees with no dept  ]




-- ## 3. Self Join [ Recursive ] | Unary Relationship

-- example : show employees data [ last_name, salary ]
--         beside his supervisor [ last_name, salary ]

-- Query inside another Query 
-- example : show all employees data works in dept ( the same dept for emp no 115 ) ( donot show employee no. 115 )

-- example : show departments data which have no employees
